He suffered from dsylexia, which made it hard for him to read and write much of his life. Apart from boxing Ali was successful as a musician and received two grammy nominations. He also featured as an actor and writer releasing two autobiographies. Ali later in life suffered from Parkinsons disease. He converted to Islam and became a Muslim after 1961, and in 1966 he refused to be drafted into the military which led to him being found guilty of draft evasion so he faced 5 years in prison and was stripped of his title.
